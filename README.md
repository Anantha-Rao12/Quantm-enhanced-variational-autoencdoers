# Quantum-enhanced-variational-autoencdoer
This repository contains the source code for the paper: [Learning hard distributions with quantum-enhanced Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01592)

- The sourcecode is available under the folder `Sourcecode` with sample notebooks in `Notebooks`. 
- All datasets used for the experiments are present in `Datasets`. These include 4-qubit and 8-qubit states obtained from product states, haar states, quantum-circuit states, and quantum-kicked rotor states.
